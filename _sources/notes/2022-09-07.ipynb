    "\n",
    "Read the syllabus carefully and we will discuss on Friday\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Will there be any group work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not in the regular sense of collaborative and shared grade. There will be optional collaboration opportunities and in class discussion/troubleshooting together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses for what we cover\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How in depth does Data Science go, and what can it be used for in the industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ideas here can be used for any tabular data in industry exactly as we will cover them. At the end of the semester, we will see in less detail how to work with text and images, with a focus on translating what you learned on tabular data (because its low dimensional and easier to see/faster to process) to more complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk more about this on Friday and every time we use a new dataset in class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the difference between data analytics and data science? Are analysts and scientists jobs different?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hard question. It varies company to company. It is, however, a topic a lot of Data Science Bloggers write about.  If you find some you like, share them on the discussion board or submit a PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the main site\n",
    "\n",
    "[this is it](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall22/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### do these prismia chats stay up after class or go away?\n",
    "\n",
    "They persist. You can scroll back or get a transcript by clicking the `>` in the top left, then the 3 bar menu icon and then \"Get Transcript From Class\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can we open jupyter notebook server without the terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you can, but I do not use it that way and they change how that works from time to time, so I can only troubleshoot with you via the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which IDE to use? Can we use VSCode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your will be required to submit jupyter notebooks that are compatible with some other jupyter related tools I use to process them for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Will we all have a single server to have various notebooks for assignments, or will we be required to make different servers for other assignments?\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook web server is something that you will start and stop many times, each working session you'll stop it.  You can run multiple in parallel or use one and open multiple notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Will we do any web scraping in this class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Will we be able to choose our own data sets when doing assignments?\n",
    "\n",
